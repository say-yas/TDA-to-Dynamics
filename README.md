**Repository Overview**  
This repository accompanies the publication, _"Topological Data Analysis Application to Dynamical System Time Series and Images,"_ providing implementations of two scenarios that correspond to the research presented in the paper. Each scenario offers tools and instructions for analyzing dynamical systems using Topological Data Analysis (TDA) methods.

## Scenarios and Setup Instructions

### Scenario 1: MATLAB Implementation

- **Purpose**: To generate the time series data and phase space images of dynamical systems.
- **Instructions**:
  - Run the `like_rossler.m` file in MATLAB to generate the time series and phase space images.

### Scenario 2: Python Implementation

The Python folder contains Jupyter notebooks that analyze topological features of the data generated by MATLAB and extract machine learning features.

1. **`Simplex_creation.ipynb`**  
   - **Purpose**: Introduces simplexes, Betti numbers, and Euler numbers, providing foundational topological calculations.

2. **`point_cloud_to_persistent_diagram.ipynb`**  
   - **Purpose**: Walks through an example using point clouds, constructing Rips filtrations, and calculating homology.

3. **`simplexes_and_homology_calculation.ipynb`**  
   - **Purpose**: Implements Rips complex creation on the time series generated by MATLAB, offering an introduction to Rips complex.

4. **`cubical_homology_grayscaleimage.ipynb`**  
   - **Purpose**: Computes V and T construction homology of grayscale images of dynamical systems.

5. **`machine_learning_features.ipynb`**  
   - **Purpose**: Converts persistence diagrams into machine learning features, including persistent landscapes, persistence images, and Betti curves.
